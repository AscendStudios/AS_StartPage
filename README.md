# Using the terminal

There’s a terminal like interface on it that you can type commends into. I’m still working on adding new functions, but for now here’s some of what you can do:

- `g` or `google`
  - Without any  additional text, this will take you to google
  - If you add text after - it will search whatever you typed
    - `g cats` would search cats on google
- `links`
  - This will show some preset links that I made
- `hide`
  - This will hide the links
  - Eventually I’m going to add additional things like weather, and hide will hide what ever is currently being shown
- `user`
  - This will change the name displayed in the terminal prompt
    - If you don’t specify a name; then it will use the default “root”
    - If you add a name, it will change it to that new name
      - `user casey`
- `loc`
  - This will update the location in the prompt
    - If you don’t specify a new location then it will use the default “~”
    - If you add a location, it will change it to that new location
      - `loc /home`
- `prompt` + "Some text"
  - This will completely change your prompt to be anything you want
    - `prompt I am Cool: `
  - To go back you can either type it as it was or change the user or loc setting - These always rebuild the default prompt
- `clock`
  - Shows the time
  - Currently this is limited to the terminal, but in a future update I will include it as a large item that will work like links
- `clear`
  - This clears your terminal history.
- <Up-Arrow>
  - This will recall your last command (makes it easy to issue the same command again or fix a typo)
- `help`
  - Prints a quick message reminding you of these commands.
  - Although not fully implemented just yet
